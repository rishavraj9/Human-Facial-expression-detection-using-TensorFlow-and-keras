Introduction:-
Facial expression detection is crucial for many applications, such as emotion analysis, mental health monitoring, and human-computer interaction. Our study intends to develop a dependable system that can identify emotions from facial photos, including fear, contempt, surprise, wrath, sadness, and happiness.
Dataset:-
Personal images datatset and own paths.
Model Architecture:-
Our deep learning model consists of the following layers:

1.Convolutional layers for feature extraction
2.Max-pooling layers for downsampling
3.Fully connected layers for classification
We employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to learn discriminative features from facial pixels.
Training
Data preprocessing: We normalize pixel values and augment the dataset with random rotations and flips.
Model training: We train the CNN using TensorFlow and Keras. Hyperparameters are tuned to optimize accuracy.
Validation: We validate the model on a separate validation set to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation
We evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we visualize confusion matrices to understand class-wise performance.
Usage
Install required dependencies (tensorflow, keras, etc.).
Load the pre-trained model or train your own using the provided script.
Use the trained model to predict emotions from facial images.
